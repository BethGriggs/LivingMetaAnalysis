# LivingMetaAnalysis
MEAN.io stack version

### TODO
- change array parsing to use database
- studies tags
- add blanks
- gain rep for contributions (github style - contributed to: etc)
- implement addInterpretation / addStudy
- just query meta-analysis as opposed to all studies
- addExpose api route
